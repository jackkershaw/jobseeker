# Jobseeker

- A job board that refreshes every three days.
- Built in React and Tailwind CSS, bootstrapped with Vite.

## Why?

I built this tool because I wanted a way to collect job sites. Initially, I tried doing this through an RSS reader but given most sites don't have RSS, an API, or need a login - I decided to build something myself.

I read recently about Cory Doctorow's [unusual use of 100 or so open tabs](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/25/today-in-tabs/), as a way to check all the websites he wants to look through daily. I already have some tabs that open every time I open Firefox, so using this method for job sites seemed too overhwhelming - better to use a website I could edit and share with friends.

## To do

- Remove from list when clicked
- change daily (see the daily challenges site)
- open all links button under job boards.
- Confetti when opened all of them.
- quiet mode, less options have to click more.
- dark mode/prefers light mode
- add some animation on page launch,use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-OYWMb9BCk or
  (tailwindcss-animate plugin)[https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate] for animation.

## How to deploy

NPM install
NPM run dev - for local development
NPM run build - for production

## Contributions

- I welcome any contributions to the project! Feel free to fork it if you want too - it's quite front-end/design focussed atm so would welcome a backend version.
