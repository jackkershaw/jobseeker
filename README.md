# Jobseeker

- A job board that refreshes every three days.
- Built in React and Tailwind CSS, bootstrapped with Vite.

## Why?

I built this tool because I wanted a way to aggregate job sites. Initially, I tried doing this through an RSS reader but given most sites don't have RSS, API or need a login I decided to build something myself.

## To do

- Confetti when opened all of them.

## How to deploy

NPM install
NPM run dev - for local development
NPM run build - for production
